leam.simmap
===========

Plone plugin that provides a custom content type that allows GIS layers to uploaded directly to the site and rendered as an
overlay.  

SimMap is short for "simulation map" as leam.simmap was first used to diplay the results of the LEAM land use change model.
It has now become a generic tool for displaying GIS layers.
